    index.jsx

Looking at your code, I have a few questions:

1. I see that you're using `ReactDOM.createRoot()` method which is part of the new concurrent mode in React. Can you explain why you chose to use this over the traditional `ReactDOM.render()` method?

2. You're using `React.StrictMode`. Can you explain what it does and why it's important in your application?

3. I noticed that you're using Redux for state management in your application. Can you explain why you chose Redux over other state management libraries or React's built-in Context API?

4. You mentioned `export default Navbar` and `export default AddToDo`, but I don't see these components in the provided code. Can you explain what these components are supposed to do in your application?

5. How are you handling side effects in your application? Are you using any specific libraries (like redux-thunk, redux-saga, etc.) or techniques for this?

6. How are you structuring your Redux store? What kind of data are you storing in it?

Remember, there are no right or wrong answers here. These questions are meant to understand your thought process and the design choices you made while building this application. ðŸ˜Š
